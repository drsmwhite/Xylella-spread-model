# Xylella-spread-model

This code is written by Dr Steven White, CEH Wallingford (smwhit@ceh.ac.uk).  It accompanies the paper "Modelling the spread and control of Xylella fastidiosa, an emerging infectious disease of olives" which is currently under review (18/11/2016).

The matlab code simulates the spread of Xylella fastidiosa in southern Italy. 

The code has been tested on Matlab R2014b and requires the statistics toolbox to run.

There are two associated files which contain a randomly generated olive cover map and Pinky (a random number generator https://uk.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/35797-generate-random-numbers-from-a-2d-discrete-distribution/content/pinky.m).
